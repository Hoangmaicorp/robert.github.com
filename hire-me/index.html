I am looking for my next thing.
</p>
<p>
I've spent the last few years working on some fantastic products with some even more fantastic people, and I am keen to keep on doing this. I built a big chunk of <a href="http://bluefields.com" target="_blank">Bluefields.com</a>'s (500 S12, Downtown Project) alpha platform, and the company closed a $1M seed round on the basis of this product. I then spent a fantastic 12 months attacking corporate email at <a href="http://copyin.com" target="_blank">Copyin.com</a>, where we built some beautiful software that obliterated our own problems but sadly not enough of other people's. I wouldn't change anything though.

</p>
<p>
Now I want to join a fast-growing product company, most likely in the Bay Area (I have a visa). Broad sectors I particularly like include education, medicine, devtech and academia, but that might only be because I know nothing about cathedral construction or banana plantations.

</p>
<p>

By trade I am mostly a Rails engineer, with all the good jazz that comes with this - JS, Coffee, Ember, Backbone, Postgres, git, Heroku and many other keywords. I'm not religious though; I've fiddled with PHP, Python and Prolog and had a great time with 2 of them.

</p>
<p>

I thought that I just invented a pretty solid pun (Py-curious), but a quick Google suggests that I am not as original as I had hoped.

</p>
<p>

For what it's worth I have a BA in Physics from Oxford University and an MSc in Advanced Computing from Imperial College.

I've written quite a few things that I think on <a href="http://robertheaton.com" target="_blank">my blog</a>. I've had >100,000 visitors in the last 8 months, and <a href="http://robertheaton.com/2013/04/01/check-youre-wearing-trousers-first/">Check you're wearing trousers first</a> was <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/319196730367299586" target="_blank">tweeted by DHH</a>. Which is slightly tenuous social proof, but it's still DHH damn it. I'm also proud of:

and my GA vanity metrics would be very pleased if you checked them out

</p>
<p>
Further fun facts to close:
<ul>
  <li>I founded and sold a <a href="http://qcumberclothing.com" target="_blank">clothing company</a> that makes jumpers with pictures of fruit on them</li>
  <li>I paid for university by playing online poker</li>
  <li>I came 30th in the European U18 chess championships</li>
  <li>I taught C# and VB for a year at Kingston College and Kingston University</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I am currently based in London, and am looking for opportunities in the San Francisco Bay area. I have a 3-year H1B visa that hasn't started yet (from my time at Copyin) which the lawyers assure me can be transferred to another US company quickly and painlessly.

</p>
<p>
I'm mostly going to be chilling for November and December and am planning on sorting out my life in January, but if you think we could do beautiful things together then get in touch and we'll hit the ground running.
