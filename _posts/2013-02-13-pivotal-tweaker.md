**tl;dr**

I made a Chrome plugin called Pivotal Tweaker, it makes your Pivotal Tracker [better](#better). You can download the plugin by click on this huge button:

Couple months ago I started working in [Copyin](http://copyin.com), where I first started using [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com). <br/>
I still remember the first day, while trying out the product, there came a bug(duh). As an exercise, I was asked to put in a story in Pivotal right away. At this point I know nothing about Pivotal.

I dived right in. "Click on the big blue button," "change it from feature to a bug," "now assign it to Rob," "here's icebox, backlog and current," "you can estimate work time, mark stories from start to finish to delivered, and someone can come in to accept it"... I had close to zero idea as how this thing works, there seems to be a million stories all in different colours, where is the story I just added in? Where does it say it was assigned to Rob? What do those columns mean?

All in all the experience was pretty disorientated, my first impression on Pivotal Tracker was bad.

After a few weeks in, Pivotal started to grow on me, it started to make sense, the colours were still confuisng, but the rest of the features make sense. <br>
**And how wonderful is it to be able to put a commit right in a pivotal story?**

However, there's still a lot of noise, there are little things that annoys me daily in Pivotal Tracker. What frustrated me the most was: I cannot filter my story down within coloumns. <br />
It is very clever of Pivotal to let you hide columns, allowing you focus on the current stories, but it's like a feature half done. I care about **<span class="colour-1">my</span> <span class="colour-2">current</span>** stories, not everyone else's, nor the ones sitting in Icebox. And initials in plain text brakets are not clear enough, there's not much to add, they're just texts like everything around it, except that I care about them more.

**What now?**

Since I still need to use Pivotal Tracker, I started trying to hack the features I wanted. 
One day my colleague and I was having a meeting, we put up a Pivotal screen and tried to discuss my current focus, he said:

> Oh I wish there's some way I could filter them down to your stories..

<( ‵▽′)-σ  <br />
I took my laptop and show him my Pivotal Tracker, and the immediate response was:
> Oh please can I have that as well? PLEASE!

So I wrote [this post](/2012/11/27/pivotal-stories/), where I shared how you easily toggle your stories with merely a bookmark, and how I re-styled parts of Pivotal so the information I care about jumps out.

Then our whole team found out, and they all want it! <br />
So I made **Pivotal Tweaker**.

Pivotal is a great tool, and it just got better with Pivotal Tweaker.

You can download the plugin by click on this second huge button:

And after you tried it, it'd be super nice if you could give me a [review](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pivotal-tweaker/aodalckpkgijlndlnlhblojedfboaglg/reviews) on Chrome Store, or better yet, share it or [tweet to me](http://twitter.com/muanchiou), let me know if you like it. <br />It'd just be a pat on the shoulder for me, but it's all I want! :)
